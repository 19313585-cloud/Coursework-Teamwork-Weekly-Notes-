# Mistakes in Task 3

- **Date:** Nov 2, 2025 


## Some Mistake in individual Task 3

- Due to my presvious knowledge from college. I thought the Activity diagram will be in one flow not in seperate partitions.
- Now I changed my Activity diagram and make it partitions.
- I notice that by going through practical lecture notes and presentataion.
- Complete the Activity Diagram with Explanation. 


 ## Errors:
 - It was hard to setup a Pyprus tool.
 - Connecting to git hub was unsuccessful.
 - Wait for lecture to help.

   ## NOTE: I done these gits but I don't know how I lost it. Later today I know that when i do updating gits from pyprus it automatically delete the files that I didn't pull in pyprus. So thats why the dates are changed.
