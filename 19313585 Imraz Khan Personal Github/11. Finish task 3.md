# Finish the Task 3

## Date: Nov 3 , 2025

## Finish individual Task 3

- Finish all my diagrams with explanations.
- Handover to team for a review. 
- I know its an individual task but review makes me if i am right track or find if any mistakes or missing something.

Errors:
It was hard to setup a Pyprus tool.

Connecting to git hub was unsuccessful.

Wait for lecture to help.

NOTE: I done these gits but I don't know how I lost it. Later today I know that when i do updating gits from pyprus it automatically delete the files that I didn't pull in pyprus. So thats why the dates are changed.
