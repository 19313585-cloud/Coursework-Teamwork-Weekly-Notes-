# Progress the Task 3

- **Date:** OCT 30, 2025 


## Start individual Task 3

- Complete building the USE-CASE diagram.
- Finish the Activity Diagram.
- Write the explanation of diagrams.


 ## Errors:
 - It was hard to setup a Pyprus tool.
 - Connecting to git hub was unsuccessful.
 - Wait for lecture to help.

   ## NOTE: I done these gits but I don't know how I lost it. Later today I know that when i do updating gits from pyprus it automatically delete the files that I didn't pull in pyprus. So thats why the dates are changed.
