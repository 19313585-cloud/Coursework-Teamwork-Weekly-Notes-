## Receive Review Task 2 by Team

- The Task 2 was handover to review by team. Which I successfully receive it today.
- Here is the Review I got:
    -  # Willow Fane:
        - Good and clear structure, which made it easy to understand 
        - Each paragraph was detailed and clearly referred to the section of the coursework case study.
        - References after each paragraph showed the exact research documents, so it is not confusing and splits each task up
        - Improvement suggestion: you could split up the large paragraphs when making a new point so it is not so chunky



    - # Abdullah Azmat:
        - Everything is explained clearly with its use and practical example.
        - All the different sections have been properly written while keeping the functional requirement in mind. References after each section clarify everything further
        - Try splitting up the sections into paragraphs so it's not as overwhelming.



    - # Siddharth Senthilkumar: 
        - Well defined structure and neatly explained all the points with the appropriate references.
        - The coursework specification is followed properly which is good.
        - I would also recommend splitting the paragraphs to make sure your paragraphs are not cluttered.
